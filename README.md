# Sudoku-advance-version
This project is a complex version of the sudoku game. In this game, in addition to filling blocks with appropriate numbers, players also need to dye them the with correct color.
The numbers must be placed in each square so that no two of the same numbers are placed in a row or column. In addition, the two adjacent blocks must not have the same color, and blocks with a color with higher priority must have a higher number compared to their neighbors.
